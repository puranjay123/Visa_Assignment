# Fraud Detection Assignment – VISA Assignment (Puranjay Kwatra)

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to identify **fraudulent users** based on their **activity records**, where each user has multiple transactions (activity records) described by 166 features.  
A user is labeled **fraudulent if any of their activity records is fraudulent**.

**Bonus**: Predict fraud at the **activity level** as well.

---

## 📊 Data Understanding & Preparation

- Loaded activity-level data with **476 records** and **92 unique users**.
- Each record includes features from `f1` to `f166` and a `user-id`.
- Merged with externally provided **user-level fraud labels** to build the classification target.

---

## 🧮 Feature Aggregation

- Since each user has multiple activities, features were aggregated per user using:
  - **Mean**
  - **Maximum**
  - **Standard Deviation**
- This resulted in a single feature vector per user, producing **498 aggregated features** (166 × 3).

---

## 🤖 Model Selection

- Trained and evaluated the following models:
  - **Random Forest** – Works well with complex feature spaces; used as a baseline.
  - **Logistic Regression** – Lightweight, interpretable model.
  - **XGBoost** – High-performance model, especially effective with imbalanced data.

- **Imbalance handling techniques** used:
  - `class_weight='balanced'` for Random Forest and Logistic Regression
  - `scale_pos_weight` for XGBoost

---

## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning

- Applied `GridSearchCV` on **XGBoost** to tune key parameters:
  - `max_depth`
  - `learning_rate`
  - `n_estimators`
  - `subsample`

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Given the class imbalance, the following evaluation metrics were prioritized:

- **Accuracy**
- **ROC AUC Score**

**Visualizations generated**:

- **Confusion Matrix** – Shows actual vs predicted labels
- **ROC Curve** – Evaluates model performance across different thresholds

---

## 🏅 Bonus Task – Activity-Level Predictions

- Built a **separate XGBoost classifier** to classify each **individual activity record**.
- Used the original 166 features (`f1–f166`) and **activity-level fraud labels**.
- Evaluated using:
  - **F1 Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
- Created a helper function to extract and display predictions for a specific user, enabling micro-level analysis and validation.
